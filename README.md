# MinecraftServerManager
A console application used to create and manage Minecraft servers running Paper servers

## How to use right now!
Right now, the software is in the prealpha stage of development. As of now, with the release available, you can only create new servers. In order to do so, create a new folder and put the contents of the release .zip file in it. Then, create a folder in that folder called `server`. Finally, open a command prompt in the folder and type `minecraftserversoftware -c <Server name>`. I will shorten the name of the .exe so you don't have to type that whole thing out. You can also type `--create` instead of `-c` if you would like.
